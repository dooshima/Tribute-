		<ul>
			<li>Steven Jobs was born February 24, 1955 in San Francisco, California </li>
			<li>Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, to parents who put him up for adoption at birth. He was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area during the 1960s.</li>

			<li>He dropped out after one semester to visit India and study eastern religions in the summer of 1974. </li>
			<li>In 1975 Jobs joined a group known as the Homebrew Computer Club.</li>
			<li> Jobs had realized there was a huge gap in the computer market. At that time almost all computers were mainframes. </li>
			<li>They were so large that one could fill a room, and so costly that individuals could not afford to buy them. </li>
			<li>Advances in electronics, however, meant that computer components were getting smaller and the power of the computer was increasing.</li>
			<li>He was a Silicon Valley businessman most famous for his work with the company Apple Computer Inc. which later changed to Apple Inc.</li>
			<li>In 1985 Apple's Board of Directors fired Jobs from his position with the company. He then started NeXT, a computer platform development company which dealt with higher education and business markets</li>
			<li>Jobs presented the iPhone on January 9, 2007. On August 24, 2011, Jobs retired as CEO of Apple. He suggested Tim Cook as his successor. Following Jobs' request, Jobs continued as the chairman of the Apple Inc's Board of Directors</li>
			<li>Jobs had health problems for the last few years and had a liver transplant. When he died of respiratory arrest caused by pancreatic cancer in 2011 in Palo Alto, California, he was worth $8.3 billion.</li>

				<ul>
					<li>The misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes, the ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules, and they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them.</li>
					<li>Great things in business are never done by one person. They're done by a team of people. Steve Jobs</li>
					<li>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.</li>
					<li>Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith.</li>
					<li>Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become.</li>
					<li>If today were the last day of your life, would you want to do what you are about to do today?</li>
					<li>I think the things you regret most in life are the things you didn’t do.</li>
					<li>Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.</li>
					<li>We’re here to put a dent in the universe. Otherwise why else even be here?</li>
					<li>Sometimes when you innovate, you make mistakes. It is best to admit them quickly, and get on with improving your other innovations.</li>
					<li>My favorite things in life don’t cost any money. It’s really clear that the most precious resource we all have is time.</li>
					<li>I’m convinced that about half of what separates successful entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure perseverance.</li>
					<li>We he had everything to gain. And we figured even if we crash and burn, and lose everything, the experience will have been worth ten times the cost.</li>
